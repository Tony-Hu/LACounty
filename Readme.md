# Welcome to use LA county PDF filler. 
## --How to use it-- It's very easy to use.
0. To use this application, you need to download and install Java Runtime Environment(JRE) 8.(See https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html).
1. The following empty PDF files should be put in the same directory of the application(named LACounty2.jar in located in <code>out/artifacts/LACounty2_jar</code> folder) before running the application.<br>
cr180.pdf<br>
cr181.pdf<br>
fw001.pdf<br>
fw003.pdf<br>
pos040.pdf<br>
cr115.pdf<br>
Notice that, you can only name the PDF file in the given name. No name change allowed! If there is an absence of input PDF, the corresponding output PDF will be absent.

2. Then, double click on LACounty2.jar located in <code>out/artifacts/LACounty2_jar</code> folder, fill in the defendant's info. Notice that, you are allowed to keep some input blank. Click OK to generate filled PDFs, or, click clear to re-enter the info.
3. Once clicked on "OK" button, get your result in the "outputs" subfolder named "xxxx result.pdf" where "xxxx" is the original name of the input PDF.  

--What does the program do--
It intakes defendant's info as input, including name, case number, address, zip code, phone number, Email address and birthday. Then, the program will automatically fill up the 6 PDFs with given info. And the filled-up PDFs will be saved in the "outputs" subfolder. 
The program saves 90% time for filling these forms which offer less chance to make a mistake.
